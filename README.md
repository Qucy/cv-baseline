## CV baseline papers and networks

This is an article help me or you to understand some of baseline papers or networks for computer vision. Before we get to start, we need to the know **ILSVRC**, stands for ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. It's started by Fei Fei Li since 2010 and held consecutively for 8 years, which push computer vision forward for a lot..a lot...(you know what I mean)

This challenge contains Image Classification, Object localization, Object detection, Object detection from Video, Scene Classification and Scene parsing. Famous models like AlexNet, VGG, GoogleNet, ResNet and DenseNet are come from this competition. We will go through these models one by one.
